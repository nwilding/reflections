What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    Initializing a repository creates a .git folder. No commits are yet made, and no files are yet added to the repository. This needs to be done to start tracking a project using the git versioning system.
How is the staging area different rom the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    The staging area is a place where you can prepare the files that will be added to a commit. It offers a sandbox that can have files added or removed to prepare a commit that represents one logical change.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
    The staging area can be used to add only the files which were modified in the completion of the logical change to a commit, omitting those files which may have unrelated changes.
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
    Branching helps keep the history organized by allowing a copy ofthe master code froma point in time within which you can make significant changes without impacting the work going on in the master branch. If the changes work out, the branch can be merged back into the master branch (trunk in SVN).
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
    A diagram helps visualize the branch structure by showing which commits the branches stem from, and what the common ancestors of the branches are. It also shows how making changes to an earlier checkout, without naming the branch can mean that you'll only be able to access those changes if you recall the commit ID, as there is no parent branch name to follow.
